For my eyes, Version History don't read if you want to be suprised!:

V 1.0 - A New Breed

All stats for final evolution mons have base stat total of 555, except for some with special circumstance and pseudo-legendaries/legendaries.

All pokemon can evolve from levelup.

Learnsets have all been updated to include moves all the way up to lvl 100.

Configs for the 60fps battle, national dex on, faster text boxes, gen 8 exp, critical capture, and exp on capture. *need to add configs and future changes for level caps*

V 1.2 - A New Encounter

Add new encounters to all routes, caves, all random encounters. All the way up to gen 5.

Methodology for V1.2 - Do 5 routes, compile changes and test rom, save in GitHub, repeat until done.
